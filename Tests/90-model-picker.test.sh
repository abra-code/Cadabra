# Recently-opened models used to be the one gap: they came from `defaults read
# com.abracode.Cadabra`, and cfprefsd keys the user domain by uid rather than by $HOME, so the
# developer's real recents were read here and could add rows that no fixture put there. They
# live in the app's own settings file now, which the isolated home does cover, so they are
# asserted below like everything else. Row counts are still stated per path rather than as a
# total, which is the honest shape for a list assembled from a disk scan.
