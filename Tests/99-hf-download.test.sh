# Tests/99-hf-download.test.sh - the model downloader, and the one property everything here is
# really about: a file the app is in the middle of writing must never look like a model.
#
# The bug this file was written for shipped for months. curl wrote straight to
# Fixture-Q4_K_M.gguf, so any death the handler could not clean up after - a force quit, a
# panic, a power cut - left a truncated file at exactly the name the model picker scans for.
# The picker listed it, put a plausible size beside it, and handed it to a loader that could
# only fail. Nothing anywhere said why, and the user's only clue was a model that did not work.
#
# Every transfer now lands in "<final>.part" and is renamed into place only once it is whole
# AND the right size, so the assertions below are mostly of the form "after the interruption,
# what does the picker see". That question is asked through the applet's own model_engine and
# model_any_installed rather than by looking for files, because those two are what the picker
# and the first-run check actually ask.
#
# THE NETWORK IS A FAKE (helpers/fake_curl.sh, reached through the CADABRA_CURL seam). It is
# not there to simulate Hugging Face; it is there because every case worth testing is an
# interruption, and interruptions are what a working server never gives you.
#
# POSIX sh only. Validate with "sh -n", never "bash -n".
