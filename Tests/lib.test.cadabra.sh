# Tests/lib.test.cadabra.sh - Cadabra's accessors for omctest.
#
# Sourced by every test file, immediately after omctest.sh itself.
#
# API 3 IS A HARD REQUIREMENT HERE, AND IT IS A SAFETY ONE. Cadabra keeps its entire
# configuration in one file under $HOME:
#
#     aichat.library.sh:  mcp_app_support="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Cadabra"
#                         cadabra_settings="$mcp_app_support/settings.plist"
#
# and plister is deliberately NOT stubbed by the harness, because the handlers depend on its
# exact read/write semantics. So on a harness that does not isolate $HOME - anything older than
# API 3 - a test that adds an agent writes the real configuration of whoever is running the
# suite, and cad_reset below deletes it. Nothing would warn: the tests would pass, in exactly
# the way that matters least. Refusing to run is the only correct response to that.
# EVERY GUARD BELOW FAILS CLOSED. That is not pedantry: the thing on the other side of them is
# `rm -f` on the developer's own settings file, so a guard that errors and falls through is
# worse than no guard, because it reads as protection.
#
# The version is matched as DIGITS rather than compared with `[ -lt ]`. A non-numeric value
# makes `[` exit 2, which is neither true nor false - the `if` simply does not fire and
# execution continues past the check that exists to stop it.

# out of the bundle rather than out of the support directory. A checkout without
# Contents/Frameworks, which is gitignored in these applet repos, is exactly that state.

# every mkdir and every other tool in the suite keeps working - a plain write to the very same

#

# file, so no accessor can store anything, so several dozen assertions across every file report
# an empty string where a value was expected. Nothing names the cause, and the shape of it -
# reads fine, writes vanish - reads exactly like a bug in the applet.

# aichatv2_launch_queue did not survive a run of 50-settings-core, and 70-mcp-servers-dialog
# failed about one time in six when two runs overlapped.
#
# omctest now keeps every board as a FILE in the per-file scratch (API 6; API 4 did it by
