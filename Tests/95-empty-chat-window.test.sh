# Tests/95-empty-chat-window.test.sh - a chat window that opens with no model, and the pick
# that gives it one.
#
# The routing is what is worth asserting here, and it is worth asserting because ONE gesture
# now has two destinations. The model bar's button arms the same handoff it always did, and
# the picker's OK decides from the target window's stamps whether that means "change what this
# conversation is talking to" (the matrix, in Tests/93) or "this window has no engine at all -
# give it one". Those two do genuinely different things to a
# live window, and nothing in the JSON or the menu says which one will happen.
#
# The engine load itself is deliberately NOT dispatched: it launches llama-server. What is
# dispatched is everything that decides where a launch goes, plus the guards that refuse to
# deliver one - including the case this file exists to pin, a launch parked in the MCP servers
# dialog while the window it names is closed.
#
# POSIX sh only. Validate with "sh -n", never "bash -n".

# The selector owns its arm for its whole life, so the chat window that asked for the model can
# be closed while the user is still choosing - and the chat window's close cannot reach an arm
# held inside a selector. Both delivery handlers then refuse, correctly and SILENTLY: the
# selector closed and nothing happened at all. The pick is worth more than that - the user
# asked for this model, and only the window they asked it for is gone.
