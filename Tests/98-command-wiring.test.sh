# Tests/98-command-wiring.test.sh - every command the engine dispatches has a script to run.
#
# This file exists because of a bug that shipped in plain sight. The main command is the first
# entry in COMMAND_LIST and carries no COMMAND_ID, so the engine resolves its script from the
# command's NAME: OmcExecutor.cp's CreateScriptPathAndShell builds "<NAME>.main" and falls back
# to a literal "main". The AIChat -> Cadabra rename changed NAME to "Cadabra" and left the file
# called AIChat.main.sh, so the engine looked for a script that did not exist.
#
# NOTHING REPORTED IT. A missing script file is not an error in this engine - it logs
# "unable to find script file" and returns - so the applet launched, ran nothing, opened no
# window, and exited with success. The suite was 774 checks green at the time, because every
# one of them dispatches a handler BY COMMAND ID and so walked straight past the one binding
# that is derived from a name instead. A whole-applet defect hid behind per-handler coverage.
#
# So the assertions here are deliberately about the WIRING rather than about behavior: given
# the command table the engine will read, does a script exist for every command it can
# dispatch. That is a question no amount of handler testing answers.
#
# POSIX sh only. Validate with "sh -n", never "bash -n".
