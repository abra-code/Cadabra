# removed (PB_DL_PARTIAL), never the shared snapshot directory.

# window on screen has stranded the user one menu away from the thing they just downloaded.
#
# Asked FIRST, and the chain requested here rather than at each exit below, for two reasons.
# The window has already ended by the time this handler runs - this is END_CANCEL_SUBCOMMAND_ID
# - so every path through this script is a path where the browser is gone, including the one
# that stops a download. And omc_next_command only SCHEDULES: the picker opens after this
# script exits, so requesting it before the "download in progress" alert does not put a window
# behind that alert.

# Consumed on read, so this survives being called twice without opening two pickers.
