# Orphaned bundle-process reaping (registry-independent safety net)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Four kinds of process run out of THIS app bundle and can outlive the session that
# started them:
#   • llama-server       ($OMC_APP_BUNDLE_PATH/Contents/Support/Llama.cpp/llama-server)
#     — the model server, one per chat window, launched with '&' from the init handler
#   • mlx-agent          ($OMC_APP_BUNDLE_PATH/Contents/Support/MLX/mlx-agent) — the
#     Chat element's ACP child, owner of the session's MCP stdio servers
#   • the bundled Python ($OMC_APP_BUNDLE_PATH/Contents/Library/Python/bin/python3)
#     — the time / search MCP servers, children of mlx-agent
#   • replay             ($OMC_APP_BUNDLE_PATH/Contents/Support/replay) — the Local
#     (files & shell) MCP server, a child of mlx-agent
# A fifth kind runs out of the bundle's agent-vm (or the developer override) but is not a
# bundle process in the same sense: `agent-vm exec`, the client that runs one program in a
# box for mlx-agent or the chat. Only that subcommand is swept; see _bundle_managed_process.
#
# A llama-server reparents to launchd (PPID 1) once its init handler exits, so the
# pid-registry teardown (stop_orphaned_servers / the cancel & terminate handlers)
# reaches it only through a stored pid. mlx-agent's MCP children reparent to launchd
# when the agent dies without tearing them down (a wedged agent, a crash). Those links
# break in known ways: a session quit before the model finished loading never
# registered its server at all; an app force-quit / crash skips the terminate handler
# completely. The leftover llama-server / python3 / replay processes seen after the app
# is gone are exactly these.
#
# reap_orphaned_bundle_processes() is the net that needs no stored child pids. It scans
# for any bundled executable reparented to launchd (PPID 1 — "no running parent") and
# kills the ones not belonging to a still-running session. Ownership is keyed on the
# HOST app, exactly as the registry records it under /server-hosts: a llama-server is
# kept only while the host app that launched it is alive. MCP servers never need
# shielding: while their session lives they are children of a live mlx-agent (not PPID
# 1), so they never match the gate. Everything else at PPID 1 in a bundled dir is an
# orphan, reaped together with its subtree (a still-alive orphaned parent's children
# have that parent — not 1 — as their PPID, so they are snapshotted before signalling).
#
# The PPID-1 gate is what makes this safe to run at any moment, including mid-launch: a
# server stays a child of the (still-running) init handler until that handler exits,
# and the handler only exits AFTER registering it — so a wanted process is never
# simultaneously PPID 1 and unregistered. Transient bundled-python helpers
# (generate_mcp_configs.py) likewise always have a living parent and never match the
# gate. Because ownership is decided by host liveness, correctness does not depend on
# running order relative to the registry reapers — those still run first to keep the
# on-disk registry tidy.

# _bundle_managed_process <args-string> [other agent-vm]
# 0 if the command's executable lives in a swept bundle dir (llama-server, bundled
# python, replay, or mlx-agent), or is an agent-vm exec client. Matches the START of the whole
# argument string, so a bundle path containing spaces is handled and a path that only appears
# as a later argument is not mistaken for the executable.
#
# AGENT-VM: ONLY `exec`, AND NEVER ANYTHING ELSE. An `agent-vm exec` runs one program in a box
# for its parent - an MCP server for mlx-agent, an external agent for the chat - and a dead
# parent leaves it at PPID 1 holding that program open, which is exactly what this sweep is for.
# Killing it is safe: agent-vm hangs the program in the box up and ends it a few seconds later.
# Every OTHER agent-vm process at PPID 1 is there on purpose and must never be touched:
#   - `box serve` is a box's supervisor, which owns the running virtual machine. agent-vm
#     detaches it in its own session so it outlives whatever started it; killing it is pulling
#     the power cord on the box, and its VM slot stays taken until macOS notices;
#   - `image create`, `image update-guest` and `image setup` run for minutes to an hour, detached
#     on purpose so they survive the window and Cadabra itself;
#   - any subcommand agent-vm adds later, which is why this is a one-entry allowlist rather than
#     a list of exclusions.
# Two binaries count: the embedded one, and the agent-vm in use when that is another one (the
# developer override, /developer/agent-vm), passed as the second argument. Exec clients started
# before the override was changed carry the old path and are missed until it is changed back.
#
# mlx-agent normally needs no sweeping: it is the Chat element's ACP child, so its stdin
# closes when the app goes away and it exits on its own (verified on a hard kill of the
# app). It is swept anyway for the case that self-teardown cannot cover - an agent wedged
# mid-generation, or one whose own MCP children outlive it - since a survivor would hold the
# session's MCP servers open. Sweeping it also reaps the agent's descendants (replay, the
# bundled python servers), which the two classes above already match.

# scan_engine_footprints [retiring_model_path] [retiring_window]

# engine already running on this machine, and how much of that total belongs to the one engine the
# caller says it is about to stop (0 when there is none, or when it cannot be identified). Never
# fails.
#
# Each engine's footprint is roughly its weights plus KV/compute overhead; 15% + 768 MiB errs on
# the safe side. The patterns match the binary BASENAME on purpose: orphaned llama-servers from
# OTHER bundles (v1.2, Enoch - see the orphan-cleanup notes) and MLXChat's mlx-agent hold GPU
# memory just the same, and a basename pattern also dodges ERE metacharacters in the bundle path.
# The argv --model validation filters out unrelated matches. The outgoing server on OUR port was
# already killed and waited out by launch_model_on_port.
#
# WHY THE SECOND NUMBER IS REPORTED RATHER THAN SUBTRACTED HERE. What may be discounted is a
# question about the machine's total RAM against the Metal cap, and those live in
# compute_server_memory_args. This scan answers what it can see; the policy on top of it is
# stated once, next to the numbers it depends on.
#
# WHICH PROCESS IS "THE ONE ABOUT TO STOP", and the answer depends entirely on whether the caller
# can NAME it. <retiring_window> is that claim, and passing it changes the rule rather than adding
# to it:
#
#   Window given: only the process whose argv carries --mcp-config .../Sessions/<window>/ counts,
#     and NO MATCH MEANS NO DISCOUNT. That marker is in an agent's argv exactly when its window
#     runs tools, so a caller that has one is a caller that can identify its own agent - and if it
#     is not there, that agent is already gone. Anything else running the same model belongs to
#     somebody else and is not about to free anything.
#
#   Window empty: the SINGLE live process running the retiring model path, or nothing. Two windows
#     on one MLX model with tools off produce two identical argvs, so the one that is leaving is
#     unidentifiable and charging both is the safe direction - which is what this did before either
#     argument existed.
#
# THE NO-MATCH HALF IS THE POINT, and it was missing from the first version of this. A window whose
# agent has already died still carries its model stamp, and a user whose composer is dead is
# exactly the user who reaches for the model picker. Its stamp then names a model ANOTHER window is
# running; under a plain "fall back to the path rule" that window's agent was the single match, and
# the discount was taken for weights nothing was about to free - permanently, since that agent
# never leaves. Refusing is right whenever the caller could have identified its own and did not.
#
# A window that runs tools but has NO MCP servers configured carries no --mcp-config either, so its
# caller passes no window and it lands on the path rule. That is the safe direction, and the same
# answer it got before any of this.

# sizing runs. It stops when the Chat element reconciles the transport that this launch is a
# prerequisite for - which is after launch_model_on_port returns, and that is after
# wait_for_server, whose limit scales with the model and reaches 300 s. The two engines are
# resident together for the whole load of the incoming one, not for a moment at the end of it.
#
# Metal caps ONE process's working set at cap_mib, so a discount of D lets the new server plan up
# to cap_mib - reserve_mib - (others - D). At the peak of the overlap the machine holds
# cap_mib - reserve_mib + D, leaving (ram_mib - cap_mib) + reserve_mib - D free. Past
# D = ram_mib - cap_mib - the slack the Metal cap deliberately leaves outside itself - the load
# eats into the display reserve, and far enough past it the transient demand exceeds physical RAM:
# a 12 GiB MLX model retiring under a large GGUF on a 32 GB machine would do exactly that, for
# minutes, which is the WindowServer starvation this whole policy exists to prevent.
#
# The clamp costs nothing in the case that motivated the discount - 5987 MiB against 8520 MiB of
# slack on that machine - and turns the unbounded version's worst case back into "the display
# reserve survives even at the peak".

# GPU memory policy (Apple Silicon).
#
# Metal caps a process's GPU working set at roughly 74% of unified memory. llama-server's
# --fit machinery sizes layer offload and context against that cap by actually measuring
# device memory, but it is blind to two things this policy corrects (both confirmed by
# experiment on a 24 GB M5, where they show up as screen flashing / on-screen artifacts
# from a starved WindowServer):
#
#   1. Sibling llama-servers. Each server sees the FULL cap as "free device memory", so
#      with one server per window the fleet overcommits the GPU.
#   2. The display server itself. --fit's default free-memory margin is 1024 MiB, which
#      is not enough headroom for WindowServer + compositor on small-RAM machines.
#
# A third, independent failure is mmap: the Metal backend wires the ENTIRE mapped model
# file into the GPU working set even when --fit offloads only some layers, so a model
# whose file is near or above the cap fails every command buffer with
# kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory no matter how few layers it offloads
# (observed with gemma-4-31B Q4_K_M, 17.8 GiB, on the 24 GB M5: -ngl 8 still OOMs;
# --no-mmap fixes it).
#
# compute_server_memory_args <model_path> [retiring_model_path] [retiring_window]
# Echoes the llama-server arguments implementing the policy:
#   --fit-target <MiB>  display reserve (RAM/8, clamped to 2-6 GiB) + the estimated
#                       footprint of every live sibling server, less the one engine the
#                       caller says it is about to stop (clamped - see the body)
#   --fit-ctx 8192      --fit may shrink the context this far before dropping GPU layers
#   [--no-mmap]         added when the file might not fully offload inside the budget,
#                       so only the layers that actually run on the GPU get wired
# Context size is deliberately NOT set: -c defaults to the model's own training limit
# and --fit shrinks it against MEASURED device memory (KV + compute buffers included),
# which beats any shell-side estimate. The retired heuristic below used to fix
# --ctx-size at up to 131072 computed from total RAM, which --fit is not allowed to
# shrink - on small models that alone could blow the GPU budget.
#
# GPU-stress testing overrides: if /tmp/aichatv2_srvtune exists (and is owned by the

# is ours to stop here.
#
# Accepted limitation: a SECOND concurrently-running OS instance of this same bundle would have
# its servers reaped too (same bundle path, no per-instance signal available at terminate). Note
# this is a SECOND OS-level copy of the app, NOT the several-models-in-one-app case this handler
# is built for: those all belong to this one instance and are all ours to stop. If two OS copies
# are ever supported, ownership will need a per-instance token wired in at launch, not
# reconstructed here.

# The last two are for the one caller that starts a server while the engine it is replacing is
# still holding memory: an in-place switch arriving at gguf from mlx, which cannot free the
# outgoing agent until the transport it is about to build has been injected. They go straight to
# compute_server_memory_args; scan_engine_footprints is where they mean something.
#
# <retiring_window> is DELIBERATELY NOT <win_uuid>, though it is usually the same string. It is a
# claim that this caller can identify its own agent in the process table, which is only true when
# that agent was launched with an --mcp-config - so the caller passes it or leaves it empty, and
# reusing <win_uuid> here would assert something the caller has not checked.
#
# Every other caller omits both, because by the time they launch there is nothing of theirs left
# to retire - a first load's window was empty, and a gguf-to-gguf switch's outgoing server was
# TERMed and waited out by the free step below.
#
# Multi-model: <port> is the window's own port (find_free_port_in at init, stashed as
# aichatv2_port_<win>). On a NEW window it is a freshly-allocated idle port, so the free step
# is a no-op and the launch coexists with every other window's server. On an in-place
# gguf->gguf switch it is the SAME port the window already owns, so freeing it TERMs this
# window's outgoing server and the incoming model takes the port back - the agent's argv names the
# port and not the model, so nothing has to be re-injected and the agent's own conversation
# carries over. Other ports are never touched here.
