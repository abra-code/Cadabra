# A sidebar row was clicked: load that conversation into the embedded Chat element in place
# (re-injecting states["content"] REPLACES the displayed transcript) and bind this window to
# the session so typing continues it. Switching is SEAMLESS: the "defer" prime directive
# displays the transcript without touching the agent's context. The Chat element replays the
# conversation into the model (ACP session/prime) lazily, only when the user actually sends a
# message into it, and skips the replay when the agent already holds that conversation
# (browsing away and back is free). The element's status bar dot shows whether the context is
# loaded or loads on the next message.
#
# One conversation in the sidebar does ask a question: a LONG one, once, the first time it is
# resumed. That is the single case where "defer" is not free - the replay still happens, it is
# just deferred, and on a small context window it may not fit at all. See the digest section in
# aichat.history.library.sh. Everything below the threshold, and everything already answered
# for, stays exactly as seamless as it was.

# A RESUME IS THE FIRST MESSAGE SENT INTO A CONVERSATION, NOT THE CLICK THAT DISPLAYED IT. Marking
# it here recorded one for every row the user touched, so browsing a handful of conversations left a
# run of "Resumed with <model>" lines in each with nothing between them - a transcript claiming a
# history of conversations that never happened. Clicking a row is reading, not resuming.
#
# So arm it here and let aichat.chat.entry.sh write the marker when a turn actually arrives. The
# flag carries the SID rather than a bare 1, and that comparison does real work: the window is not
# re-bound until further down this script, so for the few tens of milliseconds it takes to get there
# the flag names the conversation being opened while the session still names the one being left. A
# turn finalizing in that gap - the user clicks away while the agent is still answering - would
# otherwise stamp a resume onto the conversation they just left. It also covers the easier case of a
# conversation armed here and then abandoned (New Chat, another row, a delete).
#
# The marker for this conversation is MINTED further down and handed to the element, which holds it
# until there is a message for it to lead. Nothing is displayed by the click itself - that was tried,
# and a run of "Resumed with <model>" at the bottom of every conversation the user had merely looked
# at is the same false claim as recording one, made to the person instead of to the journal.

# Load the transcript into the chat (replaces whatever was shown) and bind the window to the
# session so aichat.chat.entry.sh appends new turns to it instead of minting a new session.
#
# CONDENSATION IS ASKED FOR HERE AND PERFORMED BY THE AGENT. When this conversation is set to
# summarize, the injected content carries a condense request alongside the defer directive, and
# the agent summarizes at the next send - the same moment the deferred prime happens anyway. The
# DISPLAY is untouched either way: the window keeps the whole conversation while the model is
# given a summary of its older half, and the element appends a marker showing what that summary
# said. Nothing here summarizes anything itself.
#
# The request names WHICH model summarizes, which is why the menu under the chat means what it
# says. It used to name only "summarize", leaving the summarizer to a flag fixed when the agent
# launched - so the conversation could be summarized by a model the user had not chosen, and the
# only sign of it was the name in the marker afterwards.
#
# An agent that does not understand condense primes the complete history and says so, so asking
# costs nothing on a transport that cannot serve it.
