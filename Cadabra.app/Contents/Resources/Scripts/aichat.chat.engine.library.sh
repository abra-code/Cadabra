# aichat.chat.engine.library.sh
# One question, asked by everything that changes what a chat window is talking to: what has to
# happen before this window can talk?
#
# It was the tail of aichat.chat.init.sh, and it moved out the day a window could open with no
# model at all. Three entry points need every word of it now - the window that launches WITH a
# model, the empty window handed one afterwards (aichat.chat.load.model.sh), and the window whose
# conversation is moved to another model (chat_engine_switch, below) - and the four engine
# branches are exactly the kind of code that goes wrong when it exists twice: the escape hatch,
# the availability gate, the port pinning and the "refusing to inject an empty transport" checks
# each guard a failure that is invisible until a user hits it. So they live here once, in
# chat_engine_transport_config, and every entry point reaches the same code rather than a copy.
#
# WHY A LATE ENGINE WORKS AT ALL, AND WHY A SWITCH DOES TOO. The Chat element defers building its
# transport until states["config"] lands - so a window that never received one is not broken, it
# is waiting, and its composer stays disabled until this library speaks. It does not FREEZE what
# it built: re-injecting an identical config is ignored, and a different viable one re-configures
# the element in place - the old agent is stopped, a new one is built from the new argv and
# primed from the transcript on screen. That is the whole mechanism behind chat_engine_switch,
# and it is why every pair of local engines is reachable and not just gguf-to-gguf.

# THE TITLE IS NOT ONE OF THIS LIBRARY'S OUTPUTS. There was a chat_engine_title here, guarding
# the one rule the title had left - a window showing a saved conversation keeps its name, so

# slow enough to reach wait_for_server's ten-second mark had its status written STRAIGHT to the
# title, past the guard, and every call that would have put the title back was the guarded one.
# A window with a conversation open therefore kept "still loading model…" for as long as it
# stayed open, over a model that had finished loading and was answering.
#
# Deleting the guard would have fixed that and left the rest: a title strip over the sidebar,
# too narrow for either of the things it was being asked to name. So the whole channel is gone

#   A plain command like chat_engine_transport_config, for the same reasons.
#
#   The box is started here, under the loading overlay, before the transport exists: the

#   failure anywhere below is released here, and a window that closes later releases it through
#   aichat.chat.cancel.sh.

#   Agentic Session Tools, which every boxed session is routed through, and where the user also
#   chooses whether it is shared read-only (acp_agent_read_only). No MCP servers go into a
#   box yet (Cadabra's servers live at paths on this Mac), so tools are dropped with a line in the
#   log rather than refused: the agent brings its own tools, and they run in the box.

#   (an edited command) and "custom:N" (a saved agent) run their command as typed, with no

#   The last two are only ever set by the one caller that starts a server while the engine it
#   replaces is still resident - the switch arriving at gguf from mlx - and are passed through to
#   launch_model_on_port, which is where they mean something. The window among them is a claim that

#   launch_model_on_port under them, log their progress there and that log is the handler's own
#   record of what happened. A command substitution would capture those lines in front of the
#   JSON, the element would reject the value it was given, and the load would look like a silent
