# ── Engine detection and per-engine model facts ───────────────────────────────
# The app drives three engines from one picker, so exactly ONE place decides what a path IS;
# the picker rows, the info pane, the RAM check and chat.init's argv all dispatch on this
# rather than re-deriving it. For the two local engines the distinction is a SHAPE
# difference, not a naming convention: a GGUF model is a single FILE, an MLX model is a
# DIRECTORY holding config.json + *.safetensors shards. That is why callers cannot just stat
# the path, and why "size" and "display name" mean two different computations per engine.

# Apple's on-device system model has NO PATH: it belongs to the OS, is not downloaded by us,
# and cannot be revealed, deleted or sized. Every flow here is keyed by "the selected model
# path", so it travels as this sentinel rather than as a special case threaded through the
# picker, the pasteboard handoff and the launch queue. It cannot collide with a real model:
# every scanned path is absolute, and this one has no leading slash.
FOUNDATION_MODEL_ID="foundation:apple-on-device"

# mlx_shards_complete <dir> -> 0 if <dir> is an MLX model with ALL of its weights present.
#
# THE COMPLETENESS QUESTION, not the shape question, and the difference is a model the picker
# should never have offered. A multi-shard model interrupted halfway - a crash during a
# download, a copy that stopped - leaves config.json beside SOME of its shards, which is
# indistinguishable from a whole model to anything that just asks "is there a safetensors in
# here". That is what model_engine used to ask, so the picker listed the wreckage, sized it,
# and handed it to a loader that could only fail.
#
# model.safetensors.index.json is the authority when it exists: it names every shard, so
# "every name it lists is on disk" is the real test. Names are taken from the whole file rather
# than from the weight_map alone - the map is the only place they appear, and a grep for
# "*.safetensors" cannot pick up anything else that would be wrong to require.
#
# WITHOUT an index there is nothing to be incomplete against: a single-file model is all or
# nothing, and a repo that ships one shard and no index is a complete model. So that case keeps
# exactly the old test - any *.safetensors within maxdepth 2 - and this function only ever
# narrows what it can actually prove is missing. -maxdepth 2 because shards normally sit beside
# config.json but some repos nest them one level down.
#
# Called per picker row, so both branches stay cheap: one grep over a small JSON, or one
# bounded find that stops at the first hit.

# Whether to OFFER the on-device model, and what to say when it is not usable. The agent owns
# this answer (it is the process that links the framework), so ask it rather than reimplementing
# the checks here. Bare `fm-check` does not generate - it is the availability question alone,
# ~0.01-0.05s - which is what makes it affordable on a path the picker walks on every open and
# row click. `--test-prompt` would add a real generation (~0.3s) and prove nothing we need here.

# foundation_probe -> "<reason>\t<human summary>\t<context window>\t<locale ok>\t<languages>" on
# stdout; exit 0 only when
# usable. The third field is the model's real window in tokens, empty when it could not be read.
#
# Diagnostics go to STDERR. Stdout is the return value and every caller splits it with `cut`.
#
# BRANCH ON THE REASON, never on the summary: the reason is a stable code from the agent, the
# summary is prose written to be read and reworded. The codes that matter to a caller:
#   available             usable now
#   appleIntelligenceOff  the one the user can fix - offer the Settings hop
#   modelNotReady         assets still downloading; retry later
#   deviceNotEligible     this Mac never will be
#   osTooOld / notBuilt   nothing to offer
#
# `unknown` is the agent's own code for a framework reason it did not recognize, and it is also
# what this function reports when the agent printed an availability line but died before the
# machine-readable one. Two more are invented here, for cases the agent cannot report because it
# never got to speak: `timedOut` (it did not answer inside the bound) and `probeFailed` (it
# answered with nothing usable - a crash, or a binary too broken to run). All three stay
# offerable: none of them is a verdict of "never".

# ── Recently opened models ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The picker lists what it finds in the standard caches. A model the user opened from anywhere
# ELSE is not in any of them, so this list is the only reason such a model appears in the
# picker at all - lose it and the model silently drops out of the UI the next time the dialog
# opens, while still sitting on disk exactly where the user put it.
#
# It lives in the app's own settings file, a THIRD subtree beside /servers and /agents. It used
# to live in the com.abracode.Cadabra preferences domain, written with PlistBuddy straight at
# the file - which is the one thing the note above $cadabra_settings says not to do, because
# cfprefsd owns that domain and rewrites it wholesale on its own schedule. Read and write also
# disagreed about where it was: `defaults read` asks cfprefsd, PlistBuddy wrote the file, so a
# path added by one launch could be missing from the very next read and reappear later. Here
# both ends are plister on one file, which is also the only spelling a test can observe: a
# domain is keyed by uid, so it is the developer's own preferences however $HOME is set.
#
# NOTHING HERE MIGRATES THE OLD LOCATION. Cadabra has not shipped, so the only people with a
# list in the preferences domain are the ones who built it - and carrying a one-time move
# inside the app would mean shipping it forever, running on every launch, for a case that
# stops existing at release. Tools/migrate_recent_models.sh does it once, from outside.
