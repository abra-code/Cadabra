# Swaps the detail pane for the kind of row that was picked, loads its command into the
# editable field, and enables OK.
#
# The command field is the contract, not the table row: whatever ends up in it is what gets
# stored and run. Selecting a row seeds it; the user is free to edit afterwards.
#
# Two kinds of row, two panes. A built-in agent gets the About text - what it is, whether it is
# here, how to install it, where to read more - and none of that is editable, because it
# describes somebody else's product. An agent the user saved gets the editor, and gets it
# WITHOUT having to ask for it: there is no Edit button, selecting the row is the edit.

# The claim is taken as LATE as possible on every path below - after the catalog scan, after the
# record reads - never here at the top. Clicking two rows in quick succession runs two of these
# at once, and while one painter inside its bracket is provably consistent, two overlapping
# brackets are not: they can interleave their writes and leave one agent's fields under another
# agent's signature. A short bracket does not make that impossible, it makes it improbable.
