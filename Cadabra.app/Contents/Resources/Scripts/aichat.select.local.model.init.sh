# aichat.select.local.model.init.sh
# Discovers local models of BOTH engines and populates the model selector table.
#
# The two engines have different shapes on disk - GGUF is a single *.gguf FILE, MLX is a
# DIRECTORY of *.safetensors shards + config.json - so discovery runs twice per root and
# both kinds land in ONE list. Which engine a row will use is not a user setting; it is
# implied by what the model IS (model_engine, in the model library), so the format column
# reports that decision rather than offering it.
#
# ── COLUMN ORDER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Four visible columns - format icon, Model, tools icon, Size - plus a fifth the table never
# draws, holding the model's path.
#
# The order is stated in exactly TWO places that must agree: the "columns" / "columnTypes" /
# "widths" / "minWidths" arrays in Base.lproj/aichat.select.local.model.json, and the
# set_columns call plus the emit printf in this file. Reordering or renaming a VISIBLE column
# is a change to those two and nothing else.
#
# Widths are the JSON's alone, and are worth a note: a column is drawn about 17pt wider than
# the number given (cell insets), and a table whose columns total more than the sidebar
# SCROLLS SIDEWAYS rather than compressing them. 22 + 220 + 22 + 60, plus four lots of 17,
# is what fits the 400pt sidebar without a horizontal scroller. Model is the widest, which is
# what makes it the column that absorbs the slack when the split is dragged wider.
#
# What is NOT free is changing how MANY columns there are. The path column is read back by
# five sibling scripts (ok / reveal / delete / benchmark / selection.changed) as
# OMC_ACTIONUI_TABLE_10_COLUMN_5_VALUE - an index that only moves when a column is added or
# removed, not when they are shuffled. All five, and the tests, are the sweep.
#
# Command.json is NOT that inventory, though two of the five (reveal, benchmark) do name the
# variable in ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES. It is not needed: a multi-column table's cells are
# exported for every column of the selected row whether or not anything declared them
# (AddEnvironmentVariablesForAllControls, called unconditionally after the declared-variable
# loop), which is why the other three have always worked without a declaration. Update the two
# for tidiness, but do not read them as the list of scripts to fix.
#
# The path stays LAST because that is the only way ActionUI hides a column: a row may carry
# more values than there are columns, and the surplus is simply not drawn. (omc_hidden_column
# is the NIB tables' marker; ActionUI's Table does not implement it.)

# while a letter is read the same way the badges it replaces were. They render in ONE tint -
# a Table's foregroundStyle applies to the whole view, so per-row color would need real image

# yet, every other row is absent and this one is the whole answer to "can I chat at all".
#
# Listed while unavailable because the two states a user can act on - Apple Intelligence
# switched off, assets still downloading - are invisible from here. Hiding the row would
# hide the feature AND the remedy, leaving nothing to discover and nothing to click. The
# row says which state it is in; picking it explains and offers the fix (see the ok handler).
# It is omitted only when this Mac is KNOWN never to support it - which is not the same as "not
# usable now": a reason this build does not recognize is listed too, because a newer macOS can
# add states and reading ignorance as "never" would retire the feature on the systems that just
# gained one.
#
# The size column reads "system" rather than a number: these weights are not ours, are not
# on our disk, and are not counted against the RAM budget that column exists to convey.
