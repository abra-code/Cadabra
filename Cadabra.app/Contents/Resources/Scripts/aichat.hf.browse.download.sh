# ══ Staged transfers ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# NOTHING IS EVER WRITTEN AT THE NAME A READER LOOKS FOR. Every transfer lands in
# "<final>.part" and is renamed into place only once it is whole, because the alternative is
# what this replaces: curl writing straight to Foo-Q4_K_M.gguf, and any death the script cannot
# clean up after - a force quit, a panic, a power cut - leaving a truncated file at exactly the
# name the model picker scans for. The picker listed it, sized it, and handed a corrupt model to
# a loader that could only fail, with nothing anywhere saying why.
#
# The staging name is invisible to every reader by construction: ".part" does not match the
# picker's *.gguf scan, and it is neither config.json nor *.safetensors for the MLX one.
#
# The rename is the commit, and it is guarded by SIZE. curl exiting 0 is not proof the file is
# whole - a proxy can close a stream cleanly mid-body - so a transfer whose result does not
# match the length the server declared is rejected rather than published.
#
# ── WHAT A LEFTOVER IS ALLOWED TO BE RESUMED AGAINST ──────────────────────────
# A staging file outlives the attempt that made it, which is the point, and it is also the risk:
# the thing on the other end of the URL can change in between. Resuming then splices the head of
# one revision onto the tail of another, and because the second half IS the length the server
# now declares, the result passes the size check and gets published as a model. Right length,
# wrong contents - the one failure worse than starting over, and the exact class this whole
# change exists to stop.
#
# So a partial is only resumed against the revision it came from. Every staging file carries a
# sidecar, "<final>.part.id", holding whatever identity the caller could learn about the file it
# was fetching: the ETag for a GGUF (out of the size probe that already happens) and the git
# object id from the tree listing for an MLX shard. A leftover whose sidecar does not match what
# the server says today is not a partial of this file, and is dropped rather than continued.
#
# FAILS CLOSED. No identity, no sidecar, or an unreadable one all mean "start over": a resume
# that cannot prove what it is continuing is a resume nobody can check.

# part_id_path <part-path> - the sidecar that says which revision a staging file belongs to.
part_id_path() { printf '%s.id' "$1"; }

# part_drop <part-path> - remove a staging file and its sidecar together. They are one fact in
