# app.did.launch — runs once when the app finishes launching (OMC fires the reserved
# app.did.launch command from applicationDidFinishLaunching).
#
# Offers a one-time import of the v1 (WebUI) chat history into this app's native history store.
# The user is ASKED first, exactly once ever, and either answer is final:
#
#   Import       -> run the pipeline; on success the marker records it and we never ask again.
#   Don't Import -> the marker records the refusal; we never ask and never import again.
#
# Someone else's history is not ours to move without being told to, and the answer only ever
# needs asking once - so the question is asked once and the refusal is as durable as the import.
#
# The whole flow (question included) is backgrounded so launch is never blocked. That is why the
# question can appear a moment after the window: the alternative, asking on the launch path,
# stalls the app behind a dialog the user may not answer for minutes. Imported sessions land in
# $history_root and appear in the sidebar the next time it is populated (only after a model is
# picked and the chat window opens, so the import finishes well before then).
#
# Three states, two files:
#   $marker  - terminal: imported, refused, or nothing-to-import. Its presence ends the story.
#   $consent - the user said yes but the pipeline has not succeeded yet. Lets an interrupted or
#              failed run retry SILENTLY on the next launch: consent was already given, and
#              re-asking a question they already answered would be the annoying kind of correct.
# The pipeline is idempotent (webui_history_convert.py upserts by webui-<convid> and skips
# unchanged), so a retry cannot duplicate anything.

# Best-effort single-run lock: if a prior launch's import is still running, do not start a second
# concurrent one. (The convert step is already corruption-safe under concurrency - per-pid temp
# files + a journal-completeness guard - so this only avoids wasted duplicate work.)
#
# A PID ALONE IS NOT AN IDENTITY. A lock file outlives a launch by however long the user leaves
# the app closed, which is ample time for the number in it to be handed to something else. A
# dead-pid check reads that unrelated process as "the import is still running" and skips the
# import - silently, and for as long as that process lives. So the lock records the pid AND its
# start time: two processes can share a pid number, but not also the instant they started.
#
# THE CHILD WRITES IT, not the parent. The parent used to, right after forking, which lost every
# race with a child that finished first: the child removed a lock that did not exist yet, and the
# parent then created one nobody held. Ownership end to end is what makes "no lock survives the
# run" true rather than usually true. What remains is the gap between the fork and the child's
# first statement, in which a second launch would see no lock - unchanged in size from the gap
# this replaces, and this is a best-effort lock over an idempotent pipeline.
