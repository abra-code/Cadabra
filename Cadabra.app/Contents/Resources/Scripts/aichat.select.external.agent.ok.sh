# spaces passes a plain -z test, so "   " would be stored as the command, split by shlex into

# is cleaned on the way in, so storing the raw value here would leave the record and the live
# command disagreeing over whitespace the user cannot see. acp_clean_one_line trims the ends
# and neutralizes tabs; it deliberately leaves interior runs alone, because spacing inside a

# An edit that no longer matches the row it came from is a custom command, whatever row is
# highlighted. Getting this wrong would make the label lie: the model bar would say "opencode"
# over a session running something else entirely.
#
# A SAVED custom agent is exempt, because it OWNS its command: the record is the definition
# and the field is how you edit it, so an edit belongs in the record. Degrading "custom:3" to
# a bare "custom" here would throw away the name the user gave it and leave the agent named by
# a bare basename - the row would still be in the list, and committing it would silently
# stop being the thing that was committed.
# Cleaned on both sides of the comparison, so a difference that is only whitespace does not
# read as "the user edited this" and demote a perfectly good catalog row to an unnamed command.
#
# The row is only a valid reference for this test while it is the SAME agent the pane is
# showing. When the highlight and the pane disagree - which a repaint racing a rename can leave
# behind for a click or two - the command that seeded the field is not the one carried by the
# highlighted row, and comparing against it would answer a question nobody asked. Treat that as
# edited: an unnamed command is a truthful label for "we cannot show this came from a catalog
# row", where naming the highlighted agent would be a confident lie in the model bar.
