#
# Finding and describing LOCAL ACP agents that are not the bundled mlx-agent - opencode,
# the Claude Code ACP adapter, Gemini CLI, or anything the user points us at. Sourced by the
# external-agent dialog scripts and by aichat.chat.init.sh.
#
# Why a catalog at all, when the transport only needs an argv: because "type the command
# line for an ACP agent" is a question almost nobody can answer from memory. The catalog
# turns the common cases into one click and leaves the argv editable for everything else.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT VERIFIED HERE. Three invocations were confirmed by running them on this
# machine: `opencode acp` answers `initialize` with protocolVersion 1 and agentInfo
# OpenCode/1.17.13, `kilo acp` answers as Kilo/7.1.23, and `grok agent stdio` answers with
# protocolVersion 1 but no agentInfo at all. The other catalog rows carry the
# invocations those projects document, as EDITABLE DEFAULTS rather than facts - an agent that
# changed its flags would leave a row that looks authoritative and is wrong. The dialog
# therefore probes whatever argv it is about to store, and the probe's answer is what gets
# believed. Treat a catalog row as a starting point for the argv field, never as a promise.
#
# The search covers PATH plus the places these tools install themselves when PATH is not
# what a GUI app inherits. That matters here more than usual: a launchd-launched .app gets
# a minimal PATH with none of ~/.local/bin, ~/.opencode/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin or ~/.bun/bin
# on it, so an agent the user runs happily in Terminal is invisible to us unless we look.

# Sourced HERE rather than left to every caller. The stored-selection helpers below keep their
# own accessors and no longer touch mcp_prefs_*, but they still need $plister, which the MCP
# library pulls in from aichat.library.sh - and the dialog scripts that source this one rely on
# the MCP helpers being in scope too.
#
# A caller that forgets a dependency here does not get an error - it gets `command not found`
# on stderr and a silently unwritten setting. That is exactly how acp_agent_disable became a
# no-op in aichat.select.local.model.ok.sh, which sources the model library but not this one's
# dependency: the external agent stayed enabled and hijacked the model the user had just
# picked. The MCP library is include-guarded, so sourcing it twice is free.

# Reads markdown on stdin and rewrites it into the only multi-line form this dialog's text
# renderer actually shows.
#
# The panes render markdown into a single SwiftUI Text (AttributedString .full), which is a
# FLATTENED render: block structure is parsed and then thrown away. A blank line is a real
# paragraph break, so the parser consumes it and the two paragraphs are concatenated with
# nothing between them - ".../bin/opencode acp" + "Select a row to change it" came out as
# ".../bin/opencode acpSelect a row to change it" in the shipping dialog.
#
# The idiom that works, already used by the model-info and Hugging Face panes: end every line
# with a two-space markdown hard break, and replace each empty line with a U+2800 Braille
# blank. The Braille blank is not whitespace, so the line stays inside the paragraph and
# survives as a visible gap. Block syntax (fences, lists, headings) still will not render as
# blocks, so callers should stick to inline markup.
#
# A WHITESPACE-ONLY line counts as blank here. To the markdown parser a run of spaces is just
# as much a blank line as an empty one, so testing only for "" would leave it as a line whose
# hard break gets dropped, gluing its neighbors together - the very bug this exists to avoid.

# acp_runnable <path>  ->  is this something exec can actually start?

# A REGULAR FILE THAT IS EXECUTABLE. Both halves are load-bearing and neither is obvious:
#
# -x alone is TRUE FOR A DIRECTORY. The execute bit on a directory means "searchable", not
# "runnable", so `[ -x / ]` succeeds and the whole lookup below used to report "/" - or
# "/usr/local/bin", or any name that happened to be a directory sitting in a search dir - as a
# perfectly good agent. The list drew a check mark beside a path that cannot be started, and
# the failure only surfaced later, in the chat window, as an agent that would not launch.
#
# -f alone is not enough either, and the missing bit is not a formality: the agent is started
# with a direct execve (acp_probe.py and the chat transport both spawn an argv LIST with no
# shell), so a script without +x fails with EACCES whatever its shebang says. A user who
# downloads an agent script and points us at it before chmod +x gets told so by the list.
#
# -f follows symlinks, which is required rather than incidental - most of these tools install
# as a symlink into a bin dir. Both of the ones that do so on this machine are real cases:
# /usr/local/bin/kilo -> ../lib/node_modules/@kilocode/cli/bin/kilo, and
# ~/.grok/bin/grok -> ../downloads/grok-1.0.4-macos-aarch64. A symlink to a DIRECTORY

# The rows live in Resources/acp-agents.json and arrive here through acp_catalog.py. They used

# LIST rather than a single space smuggled through a tab-separated field - the hack that
# existed only because an empty field collapses under IFS whitespace and shifts every later
# field left, sliding prose into the argv column.
#
# acp_catalog.py owns that invariant now: it never emits an empty field, and "-" means absent.
# A human editing JSON therefore cannot reintroduce the bug, which a hand-maintained TSV
# invited every time it was touched.
#
# An unreadable catalog emits NOTHING, and says why on stderr rather than silently: the dialog
# then shows an empty list, which is an obvious failure, instead of a plausible partial one.

#
# It lives OUTSIDE the agents list in acp-agents.json, behind its own subcommand, so it can
# never be picked up as an agent by something iterating the catalog. It used to be exactly

# store; for a missing one the argv column carries the un-resolved executable name so the
# dialog can still show what it would run; "empty" is a saved agent with no command typed into
# it yet, and the catalog's own custom row has no argv either - both carry "-".
#
# Two sources, in one format: the built-in catalog first, then the agents the user saved. They
# differ in what the argv column means, which is why the merge happens here rather than in
# acp_catalog.py. A catalog row names an EXECUTABLE that this function resolves to a path; a
# saved row already holds the whole command line the user typed, so it passes through
# unchanged and only its first word is looked up, to answer the Status column. Resolving a
# saved command would rewrite what the user typed underneath them.
#

# acp_agent_install_hint <catalog-id>  ->  install instructions for a missing row, or nothing
#
# Deliberately NOT part of the catalog note, because the right instructions depend on what is
# actually on this Mac. The npm-distributed row is what forced this out of the note: telling
# someone to run `npm install -g` when they have no npm at all sends them into an error
# message instead of an install. So npm is looked up FIRST, and through acp_agent_which -
# which searches the dirs a GUI-launched app cannot see - rather than trusting the PATH this
# script happens to have.
#
# Homebrew gets the same treatment for the same reason, one level down. `brew install node`
# is the shortest route to npm FOR SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAS BREW, and useless noise for anyone
# else - Cadabra is not a developer tool and brew is not on a stock Mac. So the no-npm branch
# splits again: brew present says `brew install node`, brew absent points at the nodejs.org
# installer, which is the route that works for someone who has installed nothing. Checked
# through acp_agent_which, which covers /opt/homebrew/bin and /usr/local/bin and so answers
# correctly on both Apple Silicon and Intel.
#
# And a third time for the global prefix, which is the one that actually bit. `npm install -g`
# writes to <prefix>/lib/node_modules, and on a Mac where Node came from the nodejs.org
# installer that is /usr/local/lib/node_modules, owned by root - so the plain command dies with
# EACCES. We do NOT answer that with sudo. Running npm as root is what leaves root-owned files
# in ~/.npm/_cacache, which then breaks every later npm command for that user; it is a bug we
# hit from the other end during development, and telling a consumer to sudo their way past a
# permissions error is how they get there. The unwritable branch installs into the user's own
# home instead, which needs no password and cannot poison the cache.
#
# ~/.npm-global is not an arbitrary choice: its bin directory matches the ~/.[!.]*/bin pattern
# that acp_agent_search_dirs and acp_agent_env.py already discover, so an agent installed there
# is found and launchable with no PATH edit by the user. Verified end to end - installed, the
# row flips from the cross to the check mark with the absolute path, and the probe answers.
#
# The prefix comes from `npm config get prefix` rather than being derived from npm's own path,
# because a user who has already pointed npm at a writable prefix should get the plain command.
# Measured at ~75ms, and only on selecting this one row.

# Only a row that installs through a package manager has a hint. Every other id returns
# nothing, and the caller then shows the catalog note by itself.

#
# WHERE THIS LIVES: ~/Library/Application Support/Cadabra/settings.plist.
#
# This is application data the user configured, not a macOS preference, so it belongs in
# Application Support next to History/ and the rest of Cadabra's own state - not in a
# preferences domain, and not in a new plist per feature.
#
# It is emphatically NOT in com.abracode.Cadabra.plist. That domain is written by the system
# on the app's behalf - window frames, recent items, the autosaved dialog frame this project
# already fights with - through cfprefsd, which caches the whole domain in memory and rewrites
# it wholesale on its own schedule. A script writing that same file behind cfprefsd's back
# either loses its write or clobbers the system's, and the visible result is a preferences
# file that looks corrupted.
#
# The MCP server settings now live in this same file, under /servers and /allow-network,
# which is what leaving these keys at /agents/... was for. TWO SUBTREES, TWO OWNERS, ONE FILE:
# neither library may assume it owns the file. See cadabra_settings in aichat.library.sh.
#
#   /agents/external/enabled : bool    - use the external agent instead of bundled mlx-agent
#   /agents/external/id      : string  - catalog id, so the dialog can re-select the row
#   /agents/external/command : string  - the command line AS TYPED, split with shlex at launch
#   /agents/external/verifiedCommand : string - the command Test last actually spoke to
#   /agents/external/verifiedName    : string - what the agent called itself that time
#   /agents/external/verifiedVersion : string - and the version it reported
#
# The command is stored as one string rather than an argv array on purpose: it is what the
# user typed and what the dialog shows back, so there is no place for a round trip through
# two representations to lose a quote. Splitting happens once, in acp_transport_json.py.
#
# The agent's working directory is deliberately NOT stored here - it reuses
# /servers/local/project, the workspace the user already chose for the local MCP server, so
# "the folder Cadabra is working in" stays one concept with one setting.

# $mcp_app_support is the base library's one definition of ~/Library/Application Support/
# Cadabra - the same root history_root, Sessions/ and inspect/ hang off. Reused rather than
# rebuilt from $HOME so there is a single place to change if it ever moves. Its name predates
# it being general; it is the app support root, not an MCP thing.

# WHY AN ARRAY AND NOT A DICTIONARY KEYED BY ID. The order of these is the order they appear
# in the list, and the order the user put them in; a dictionary has no order, so the list
# would reshuffle itself on every read. plister can search an array by a sub-item value
# (`find string <id> <file> /agents/custom /id` answers with the index), so keying by id costs
# one lookup rather than a data structure.
#
# IDS ARE MINTED AND NEVER REUSED, which is the whole reason customNextId exists rather than
# deriving an id from the array length or the label. The live selection stores an id in
# /agents/external/id, so a reused id would silently re-point it: remove the agent that
# selection names, add a different one, and the window would come back configured as something
# the user never chose.
#
# The counter alone is not enough to guarantee that, and acp_custom_add explains why - it is
# treated as a hint and reconciled against the ids actually in use.

# THE COUNTER IS A HINT, NOT THE AUTHORITY. It is read, then written, then the record is
# appended, then three keys are inserted - five separate read-modify-write cycles on one file,
# with no lock. plister replaces the document wholesale, so a second writer between any two of
# them is a lost update: bump the counter, lose the write, and the NEXT add hands out an id
# that is already taken. That is the one failure this whole scheme exists to prevent, because
# the live selection stores an id - a duplicate silently re-points it at somebody else's
# record. And the same hole opens with no concurrency at all if the counter is ever lost or
# rewritten as a string, since both fall back to 1.
#
# So the id is max(counter, highest id in use + 1). The counter still does the real work -
# it is what makes a REMOVED id stay retired, which the records alone cannot know - while the
# records themselves make a duplicate impossible.
#
# The bump happens BEFORE the append, so a failed append burns an id, which is the harmless
# direction. And the record is read back before the id is returned: every write below can fail
# silently (plister exits 0 having written nothing when the file is not writable), and
# returning an id for a record that is not there hands the caller a row it can select, store as
# the live agent, and never find again.

# because it needs shlex to split the typed command the same way the transport builder does
# and an OUTER subprocess timeout so an OMC subcommand can never fail to return. A shell
# wrapper cannot provide either, so the two copies would only drift - and the unused one was
# already the more careful of the pair, which is exactly how a stale helper misleads.
