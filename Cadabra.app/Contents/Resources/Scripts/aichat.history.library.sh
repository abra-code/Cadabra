# =============================================================================
# A marker LEADS the message it opens, and is RECORDED by the turn that carries it
# =============================================================================
#
# The two markers that OPEN a stretch of conversation - "started" and "resumed" - belong in front
# of its first message, and no state this app can set at the time it learns about that message can
# put them there. states["append"] appends: by the time an entry finalizes and this app learns a
# turn happened, the message that triggered it has been on screen since the user pressed Return,
# so the marker explaining what the message was sent INTO landed underneath it. The conversation
# read as if it had been started by its own first question, and since recording had the ordering
# right all along (the journal write precedes the entry's), a reload disagreed with the live
# window about the order of its own first two lines.
#
# SHOWING ONE EARLIER IS NOT THE ANSWER, and this app shipped that answer long enough to learn it:
# a marker put on screen when the window became able to answer - the engine finished loading, or a
# saved conversation was displayed - announced a handover that had not happened. Clicking through
# a handful of conversations left "Resumed with <model>" at the bottom of each, in transcripts
# nothing had been said into. Reading a conversation is not resuming it, which is exactly why the
# RECORDING half has always waited for a turn.
#
# So neither half moves, and the element holds the line until there is a message for it to lead.
# ChatView 0.5.5's states["lead"] takes the markers this window is holding and places them in
# front of the next message the user sends - the one moment at which "in front of the next
# message" is a place that exists. Nothing is displayed before then, and if the user never says
# anything, nothing was displayed and nothing was recorded.
#
# The queue below is that list: what the element was handed to place. What a turn RECORDS is what
# the element reports having placed - the message's entry carries the lines under "lead", as
# placed - and the two differ in exactly one field, the time. A held line is minted WITHOUT one,
# because it is minted when the window learns it will be needed (the click, the engine loading)
# and the user may not type for an hour; the element stamps it with the moment it places it,
# which is the moment the message was sent, and that is the time the line is written with. The id
# is minted once and travels through, so the line the user saw is the line the next load rebuilds
# - not one like it. The queue copy is the fallback, for a message whose entry arrives before the
# element received the list: stamped by the recording, which is as close to the send as this side
# gets.
#
# It also stopped the element mistrusting its own context. The append channel flips ChatView's
# context indicator to "Context on next message" when the transcript has moved ahead of what the
# agent was primed with, and mid-TURN that test used to be answered by a snapshot that only
# advances at the turn's end - so appending a marker while the first answer was streaming made a
# brand-new chat claim its context was unsynced, and cost a needless re-prime on the second
# message. The lead channel places items inside send(), before the deferred prime it belongs to,
# and nothing on the normal path appends mid-turn any more.

# The per-window queue of markers waiting for a message: ChatItem JSON, one per line (the JSON
# encoder escapes newlines, so a line is always exactly one marker). This is the app's copy of
# what states["lead"] is holding; the two are written together and must not drift.

# =============================================================================
# Resuming a long conversation without replaying all of it
# =============================================================================
#
# Replaying a whole conversation into a model costs a full prefill of every token in it, and on a
# small context window it may not fit at all. mlx-agent can summarize the older part instead and
# prime the model with [summary, acknowledgment, the recent turns verbatim].
#
# THE AGENT DOES IT, NOT THIS LAYER. session/prime takes an optional condense object; this app
# asks for it by putting the key on the injected content and the agent performs it at the next
# prime. That replaced an earlier implementation here which ran mlx-agent's offline `digest` verb
# and injected the result as the transcript - it worked, but doing it outside the element meant
# the summary REPLACED THE DISPLAY, because injected content seeds both what is shown and what is
# sent. The live path separates them: the window keeps the whole conversation while the model is
# given a summary of its older half.
#
# Nothing is lost either way. journal.jsonl is append-only and no path here writes to it, so
# switching a conversation back to replaying in full restores every original turn.
#
# WHO SUMMARIZES AND WHETHER TO ARE ONE ANSWER, HELD BY THE CONVERSATION. Both ride on the same
# condense object: keepRecentTurns asks for a summary, backend names the model that writes it. So
# the menu below decides one thing, it decides it for the conversation it was opened in, and it
# takes effect on the next message sent there.
#
# It was not always so, and the difference is worth stating because the old shape is a trap. The
# summarizer used to be the agent's --digest-backend, fixed when the agent launched and shared by
# every window; picking one in a conversation could not reach the agent already serving it. The
# menu showed the choice, the marker afterwards named the model that had actually summarized, and
# the two disagreed with nothing on screen to explain why. ChatView 0.5.3 and mlx-agent carry
# `condense.backend` for exactly this, and the app no longer keeps an app-wide summarizer setting
# at all - there is one control and it is per conversation.
#
# The marker the element appends after a condensed prime still reports which model did it, which
# is now a confirmation rather than the only way to find out.

# How many trailing messages to ask the agent to keep verbatim. mlx-agent's own default is 6, and
# it may keep MORE - it snaps the boundary back to a user turn so the tail starts cleanly.

# WHICH IS NOW EVERY ENGINE THIS APP LAUNCHES, and the previous version of this got it wrong. It
# probed for a running llama-server on the window's stashed port, because under the old design a
# summary was produced by a SEPARATE mlx-agent process: borrowing a gguf model was free (the
# server already had it) while an MLX model would have been loaded a second time, gigabytes and
# all. That reasoning died with the batch verb. The `session` summarizer uses the agent's OWN
# already-loaded model, so it costs nothing whichever engine the window runs, and the port probe
# was excluding MLX windows from a choice that works perfectly well for them.
#
# The one case it does not cover is an EXTERNAL ACP agent: its command line is the user's own, so
# it need not be mlx-agent, need not understand `condense.backend`, and this app has no idea what
# would summarize there. That is what the agent stamp distinguishes - it is set only for a window
# driven by someone else's agent.
#

# NEITHER - no model, no agent - and a bare "not somebody else's agent" answered yes for it, so
# opening a saved conversation in an empty window offered to summarize it "with the model in this
# chat" and recorded that choice for a chat that has none. Nothing breaks downstream (no transport
