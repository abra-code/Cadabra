"""history_store.py - read-model for the AIChat history store.

The write path (aichat.chat.entry.sh) appends one finalized-entry envelope per line to
each session's journal.jsonl. Each envelope looks like:

    {"data": <ChatItem>, "id": "<itemId>", "sequence": N, "type": "<type>"}

where <ChatItem> is already exactly the shape the ActionUI Chat element consumes in
states["content"].items (e.g. {"type":"message","message":{"id","role","text"}}), and a
"usage" envelope carries {"data":{"used":N,...}} which maps to the transcript's top-level
"usage". So journal -> ChatTranscript is a near pass-through: collect item envelopes'
`data` (dedup by id, last write wins, first-seen order), take the last usage/plan.

Subcommands (all read-only; never mutate the store):
    index <history_root>       -> TSV rows  "title\tsession_id" (recent first); the
                                  single-column sidebar list reads session_id as a hidden
                                  trailing field (updated date moved to the info line)
    transcript <session_dir>   -> ChatTranscript JSON object for states["content"]
    preview <session_dir>      -> markdown summary (legacy; the chat pane is the preview now)
    info <session_dir>         -> one compact line "Model: X  ·  Started: Y  ·  Messages: N"
                                  for the toggle-able info strip above the chat
    search <history_root> <query> [scope] [limit]
                               -> TSV rows "title\tsession_id" of the conversations whose text
                                  contains the query (case-insensitive substring; scope
                                  "messages" (default) or "all" to include thoughts and tool
                                  calls), most matches first, ties most recent first. The same
                                  shape as `index`, so the sidebar is filled the same way.

No third-party deps; runs under the bundle's embedded python3.

    re-asks every question the mint answered instead of trusting the shape it is handed.

    It REBUILDS rather than approves, because approving field by field is a list that has to be
    kept in step with a Codable struct in another language. SessionEvent's optionals are typed
    (`timestamp: String?`, `model: String?`), and Swift's synthesized decoder THROWS on a JSON

    from validated pieces means only shapes _session_event_item could have produced are ever
    recorded, and a field added there is a field this has to be taught about deliberately.

    The id is the one field that can break the store itself rather than the element: it keys
