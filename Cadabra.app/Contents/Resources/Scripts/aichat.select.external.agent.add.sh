#
# It is saved IMMEDIATELY, before anything has been typed into it. That is deliberate: the row
# has to exist to be selected, and the editor edits a record rather than a form, so there is
# nothing here that could be lost by not committing. The cost is a row named "New Agent" with
# no command if the user changes their mind, which the - button removes in one click.
