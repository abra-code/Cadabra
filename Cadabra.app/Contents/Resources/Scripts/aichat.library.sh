#
# THE GLOBAL KEY HOLDS ONE ARM, AND THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE SELECTOR. Opening a window
# before choosing its model is the ordinary way to work now, so two empty windows each sending
# their model bar to a selector is an ordinary thing to do - and while the arm was global the
# second one overwrote the first, so the model landed in the window the user was not looking
# at, and the first selector's later pick found nothing armed and opened a third window. The
# selector's Cancel had the mirror of it: it cleared the global key, disarming somebody else.
#
# Same move the MCP servers dialog makes with a queued launch, for the same reason: state that
# belongs to a dialog should live exactly as long as that dialog.
#
# THE SECOND GUARD IS THE CORRECTNESS ONE. The selector's init is a plain command in the SAME
# window, so Reload and Delete re-run it - and an unconditional capture then copied the (by now
# empty) doorstep over the arm this selector was already holding, losing the pick silently.
# That path is not hypothetical: the on-device model's own alert tells the user to press Reload
# and pick again.
#   - already holding one     -> it is ours; a doorstep arm belongs to a selector still opening
#   - nothing on the doorstep -> nothing to take. This one only saves two pasteboard forks per
#     menu-opened init; with it removed the function would write two empty values over two
#     already-empty keys. Kept for the cost, not claimed as a guard.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE: two model bars pressed before either selector's init runs. The
# doorstep holds one arm and model_switch_arm overwrites it, so the first window's arm is lost
# and the first selector captures the second window's. Scoping narrows that window from the
# whole life of both dialogs to the gap between arming and an init that does a full model-cache

# tools on is parked inside the MCP servers dialog for as long as the user needs there, in that
# dialog's OWN window scope - so a chat window closing meanwhile clears the global key and
# finds nothing to disarm. The launch then arrives for a window that no longer exists, and the

# reused, so a stale mark names a uuid nothing will ever ask about again. For it to do harm the
# GLOBAL load target would have to name that same dead uuid at the same time - and the one path
# that can park a launch past a window's death, the MCP servers dialog, dies with the app that

# ONE pasteboard entry carries a queued model launch: "model_path|use_tools|epoch". A single
# key keeps the model and its tools decision atomic (they can never desync the way two

# across app relaunches, so every reader validates before trusting. use_tools is "true" or

# decision at the same instant it needs the model (it builds the agent argv from both), and

# by the chat init (Finder drops onto the app arrive that way, with no tools decision).
#
# The MCP servers dialog, when the selector routes a tools-on launch through it, moves the
# queue into its own window-scoped key (aichatv2_launch_<window>) at init: the pending launch
# then lives exactly as long as that dialog, a concurrently queued launch from another entry

#
# ARMED GLOBALLY, THEN CAPTURED PER WINDOW: the same two-step model_switch_capture uses, for
# the same reason. The arming side is the main command, which has no window uuid to scope the
# key to because the window it is about does not exist yet. The browser's init runs
# milliseconds later, inside that window, and moves the mark into the window's own scope -
# after which a second browser opened from the menu cannot consume a mark that is not about it.
#
# No TTL, unlike the switch arm. Nothing user-driven sits between the arm and the capture -
# it is one command hop - and a global mark left behind by a window whose init never ran is
# claimed by the next browser to open, which opens the picker once, extra, and clears it.

# NO APP-WIDE SUMMARIZER SETTING LIVES HERE ANY MORE, and its absence is deliberate rather than an
# oversight. `cad_digest_backend` read a /digest-backend string out of the settings file and every
# chat window passed it to its agent as --digest-backend, which made "which model summarizes a
# condensed restore" a launch-scoped, app-wide answer. The control that set it is per conversation,
# so the two could not agree: choosing a summarizer for the conversation in front of you reached
# the NEXT window, and this one went on summarizing with whatever it had started with.
#
# The summarizer now rides on each restore's condense object (aichat.history.library.sh, and
# session/prime's `backend` in mlx-agent's docs/session-prime.md), so the conversation carries its
# own answer and nothing app-wide is needed. A /digest-backend left in an existing settings file by
# an older build is inert; nothing reads it.

# process_start_stamp <pid> - the instant that pid started, whitespace-normalized, or nothing
# if there is no such process.
#
# A PID IS NOT AN IDENTITY once it has been written down. Anything that records a pid and reads
# it back later - a lock file, a registry entry that outlives a crash - is holding a number the
# kernel is free to hand to an unrelated process in the meantime, and `kill -0` then reports
# that stranger as the original. Pairing the number with its start time closes it: two processes
# can share a pid, but not also the instant they began. Normalized because `ps` pads the field,
# so the same instant has two spellings and a naive string compare disagrees with itself.

# THE WINDOW TITLE IS THE APP'S NAME, AND NOTHING ELSE WRITES IT. There used to be a
# chat_window_set_status here, and six handlers reached for it to report what a window was doing:
# the model being loaded, the conversation that had just been opened, "still loading model…",
# "failed to load model". None of it fit. A NavigationSplitView puts its title over the SIDEBAR,
# in a strip a few hundred points wide, so every one of those strings arrived truncated - a
# 31B model's name and a real conversation title both die in the same ellipsis.
#
# So the title is declared once, as WINDOW_TITLE in Command.json, and left alone. What the old
# statuses said now lives where there is room for it: the model bar names the engine
# (chat_model_bar_set), the facts line describes the conversation (chat_info_refresh), the
# loading overlay describes a load in progress (above), a failure raises the alert it always
# raised, and aichat.chat.error.sh's toast is the pattern for anything transient.

# help_show_page <window_uuid> <page file in Resources/Help>  ->  loads the page into the Help
# window's WebView (id 2 of aichat.model.help.json, which every help window uses). The address is
# a percent-encoded file URL, so a space in the application's path does no harm.
