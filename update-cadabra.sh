# update-cadabra.sh
# Updates the git-excluded runtime engines inside Cadabra.app (the native-chat V2,
# rebranded from V2/AIChat.app):
#   1. llama.cpp  - llama-server + its dylibs, from a GitHub release (the GGUF engine)
#   2. mlx-agent  - built from source with xcodebuild, Release (the ACP agent + MLX engine)
#   3. pdfutil    - built from source with ./build.sh (the PDF MCP server)
#   4. replay     - built from source with xcodebuild (the local files/shell MCP server)
#   5. packages   - the Python MCP servers, pip-installed into Contents/Library/Packages
# then codesigns the bundle and verifies the engines actually launch.
#
# Stage 5 absorbs what update-mcp-servers.py did as a separate manual step. Folding it in
# means one codesign pass instead of two (that script signed, then this one signed again)
# and it means the Python servers cannot silently rot: generate_mcp_configs.py now PROBES
# every server at launch and drops any that fails to answer, so a stale or missing
# Packages dir no longer shows up as a broken server - it shows up as no server at all.
#
# Relationship to ./update-llama-cpp.sh: that script serves the V1 app (and Enoch), which
# renders its UI from llama.cpp's WebUI and therefore has to download and sed-patch
# bundle.js/bundle.css/index.html on every update. Cadabra has NO Contents/Resources/WebUI -
# the chat UI is native (ActionUI Chat element over ACP) - so ALL of that machinery is dead
# weight here and is deliberately absent rather than skipped by a flag. Cadabra also embeds
# mlx-agent, which V1 does not, so the two scripts do not converge.
#
# arm64 only for the agent: mlx-agent is Metal/MLX and does not build for x86_64. The
# llama.cpp half still accepts --arch=x86_64 (pass --skip-agent with it). pdfutil and
# replay build for either arch, so both are deployed on the arm64 and x86_64 paths.
#
# The bundle is Cadabra.app next to this script - NOT auto-globbed: the repo root also
# holds the V1 AIChat.app, which this script must never touch.

set -uo pipefail

# Applies to every invocation of the bundle's embedded interpreter in this script - the
# pip --version probe, pip install itself, and the post-codesign import checks.
#
# The app itself does NOT need this and must not set it: the OMC applet runtime exports
# PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX (Abracode's setPythonPycachePrefixIfEmbedded), which redirects
# bytecode for the embedded interpreter out of the bundle entirely. Scripts INSIDE
# Contents/Resources/Scripts therefore run with caching already handled.
#
# Maintenance scripts like this one run outside that environment, so they get no such
# redirect and would write .pyc straight into Contents/Library. Before signing that
# silently bloats the sealed payload (40 stdlib cache directories, just from running
# `pip --version`); after signing it invalidates the seal and `codesign --verify` reports
# "a sealed resource is missing or invalid". pip's --no-compile does not help: that
# governs the packages being installed, not the interpreter's own stdlib caching.

Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]

Updates the runtime engines in $(/usr/bin/basename "$APP_BUNDLE"):
  llama.cpp -> Contents/Support/Llama.cpp/   (downloaded release, no WebUI - Cadabra is native)
  mlx-agent -> Contents/Support/MLX/         (built from source, xcodebuild -configuration Release)
  pdfutil   -> Contents/Support/pdfutil      (built from source with ./build.sh)
  replay    -> Contents/Support/replay       (built from source with xcodebuild)
  packages  -> Contents/Library/Packages     (pip install with the bundle's own python3)

Options:
  --version=VERSION   llama.cpp build tag (e.g. b8797), or:
                        auto     the newest official release (default; upstream tags these
                                 vX.Y.Z and points them at the build carrying the binaries)
                        nightly  the newest build, released or not
  --arch=ARCH         arm64 or x86_64 (default: host). x86_64 requires --skip-agent.
  --identity=CERT     codesign identity (default: - for ad-hoc)
  --agent-repo=PATH   mlx-agent repo (default: ../mlx-agent sibling checkout)
  --pdfutil-repo=PATH pdfutil repo (default: ../pdfutil sibling checkout)
  --replay-repo=PATH  replay repo (default: ../replay sibling checkout)
  --skip-llama        leave llama.cpp untouched
  --skip-agent        leave mlx-agent untouched
  --skip-pdfutil      leave pdfutil untouched
  --skip-replay       leave replay untouched
  --skip-packages     leave the Python MCP packages untouched
  --clean-packages    reinstall Contents/Library/Packages from scratch, dropping orphaned
                      packages and old versions' metadata (the default; OMC's own modules
                      are kept)
  --no-clean-packages upgrade the installed packages in place instead (faster; leaves
                      whatever pip stops needing behind)
  --skip-agent-package-update
                      build mlx-agent against its committed Package.resolved instead of
                      re-resolving its SPM dependencies to the newest allowed versions
  --skip-build        deploy the existing build products without rebuilding
  --skip-codesign     do not codesign
  --help              show this message

Examples:
  ./update-cadabra.sh
  ./update-cadabra.sh --version=b8797
  ./update-cadabra.sh --version=nightly            # newest build instead of the latest release
  ./update-cadabra.sh --skip-llama                 # rebuild + redeploy the agent + MCP servers
  ./update-cadabra.sh --skip-agent                 # refresh llama.cpp + the MCP servers
  ./update-cadabra.sh --skip-llama --skip-agent    # rebuild + redeploy just pdfutil + replay

# ── 2. mlx-agent ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Re-resolve mlx-agent's SPM dependencies to the newest versions its project.yml pins allow,
# so a shipped build never quietly carries a months-old MLX because Package.resolved froze it.
#
# Why the file has to be deleted: there is no `xcodebuild -updatePackages`.
# -resolvePackageDependencies HONOURS Package.resolved and keeps a stale revision that still
# satisfies the version rules, and `swift package update` needs a Package.swift, which that
# repo deliberately does not have (Metal shaders force xcodebuild; see project.yml's header).
# Resolving with the file absent is the only CLI path that actually upgrades.
#
# The old file is copied aside first and restored if resolution fails, so a network outage or
# a yanked upstream tag leaves the checkout exactly as it was rather than pin-less. On success
# the update lands as a git diff in the mlx-agent repo - deliberately: Package.resolved is
# committed there precisely so new versions get reviewed, and this script must not be the
# thing that quietly changes them without saying so.
#
# The backup lives in a TEMP DIR, not beside the original as a .bak, and a signal handler
# restores it. Both details matter and neither is theoretical: the resolution is
# network-bound and takes minutes on a cold checkout, so Ctrl-C lands inside the window
# where the file is deleted. A signal kills bash outright - the failure branches below
# never run - which would leave the sibling repo showing a DELETED tracked file, and a .bak
# beside it that mlx-agent's .gitignore does not cover, i.e. one `git add -A` from
# committing both. (Same reasoning as the packages staging tree further down.)

# One "<identity> <version>" line per pin of a Package.resolved. Anchored on `"version" : "`
# so the trailing `"version" : 3` format marker at the end of the file (an int, not a string)
# is not mistaken for a package version. A pin with no version (branch/revision pinned) falls
# back to its revision, so a revision move is NOT reported as "versions unchanged" - the whole
# point of the function is answering "did any pin actually move?", which is not the same
# question as "did the file change": a re-resolution rewrites originHash even when every pin
# lands on the byte-identical version.
# The revision is printed in full rather than abbreviated: this output is COMPARED, not just
# displayed, and two revisions sharing a short prefix would compare equal.

# and writes it before the checkouts finish, so "the file is there" does not mean "the
# resolution completed" - a signal can leave it truncated. Re-running a resolution is cheap;
# telling the user their pins are fine when the file is corrupt is not.
#
# The copy lands on a temp name in the same directory and is renamed into place, so the real
# path is never a partially-written file: a SECOND signal arriving inside this handler (bash
# does not re-enter for the SAME signal, but does for a different one) would otherwise be able
# to interrupt the copy mid-write, and the re-entered pass would find a truncated file. The
# rename is atomic on the same volume, and a re-entered pass simply redoes the whole copy.
